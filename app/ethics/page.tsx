        <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          <p>
            Let us finish by explaining the preference-based engineering design methodology (PBED). PBED is an approach
            that integrates the preferences and values of stakeholders into the engineering design process. The goal is to
            achieve a design that not only satisfies technical and operational requirements but also reflects the diverse
            priorities of affected groups. In the case of the MOSE barrier system, this means accounting for the needs and
            preferences of local residents, policymakers, environmental organizations, port authorities, and the tourism
            sector. By incorporating these perspectives, PBED helps align technical feasibility with societal
            acceptability, ensuring that the system functions not only as an engineering achievement but also as a socially
            responsible solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            When comparing these ethical theories to the PBED methodology, <strong>utilitarianism</strong> appears most closely aligned.
            Both aim to identify the design outcome that provides the greatest benefit for the majority of stakeholders.
            In the case of the MOSE system, the intention is to protect the city of Venice from flooding, thereby
            safeguarding infrastructure, cultural heritage, and public welfare. This aligns with <strong>utilitarian</strong> reasoning,
            which prioritizes maximizing collective well-being. However, PBED differs in that it also explicitly considers
            minority stakeholder preferences, such as those of environmentalists concerned about ecosystem disruption,
            rather than focusing solely on aggregate benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, PBED can also be seen as a mix of ethical perspectives. The <strong>justice perspective</strong> is partially
            embedded in PBED through its inclusive and participatory approach, ensuring that each stakeholder has an
            opportunity to voice preferences and influence design decisions. Similarly, the <strong>rights perspective</strong> is
            reflected in the emphasis on respecting local communitiesâ autonomy and their right to a safe and sustainable
            environment. <strong>Ethical egoism</strong>, however, contrasts sharply with PBED, as PBED rejects any design process that
            prioritizes the interests of a single party (e.g., a government or contractor) over others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the positive aspects, PBED promotes transparency, inclusiveness, and trust by systematically
            incorporating stakeholder feedback. In the MOSE project, this approach helped balance conflicting interests,
            such as the need for flood protection versus the preservation of lagoon ecosystems. The iterative nature of
            PBED, revisiting stakeholder inputs across multiple cycles, allowed design assumptions to evolve and improve
            alignment between social, environmental, and technical goals. On the negative side, PBED can be time-intensive
            and may lead to compromises that dilute the technical optimality of the system. Moreover, unequal power
            dynamics between stakeholders (for instance, between policymakers and local citizens) may distort the
            preference aggregation process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, after conducting two PBED cycles with stakeholders and assigning them different weights, it can be
            concluded that PBED most closely resembles <strong>utilitarianism</strong>, as both aim to achieve the best possible outcome
            for the majority, while still incorporating fairness and respect for rights. The approach supports balanced
            decision-making for the MOSE barrier, ensuring that the protection of Veniceâs citizens and heritage is
            achieved without neglecting environmental and social concerns. <strong>Ethical egoism</strong> remains the least aligned,
            as it fundamentally opposes the collective, preference-oriented ethos of PBED.
